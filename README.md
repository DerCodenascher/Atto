## Exercise 1 â€“ Questions
### What is the difference between git and github?
Git is a version control system, whereas Github is a cloud-based hosting service that lets you manage (remote) repositories.
### Name 3 benefits of a version control system:
- Keep track of every change done to the code and revert if necessary
- Reduce code duplication and errors due to outdated code
- Facilitate simultaneous collaboration with other developers through branching and merging
### Name 3 alternatives to git:
- Subversion
- Mercurial
- Perfoce Helix Core
### Name 2 differences between git and other version control systems:
- While SVN is centralized, Git is a distributed version control system, i.e., each git installation can act as server and client. Each user also has a local copy of the repository with its full history.
- While SVN branches are based on a directory structure (a branch is created as directory), Git branches only reference specific commits
### Name known issues related to game engines (Unreal, Unity) and version control systems:
Binary files like images, videos, models or any other asset may together take up a lot of disk space and slow down operations like the cloning of a repository. Furthermore they can't be merged, which makes collaboration on an asset difficult.
